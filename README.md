# Khaled Negm Portfolio

## About

Welcome to my Portfolio. It includes my best artwork in Graphic Design, Web Design, and Photography.

### Challenges

1. Confused between coding CSS from scratch or using Bootstrap.
2. Creating a slideshow for my artwork.
3. Creating a favicon.

### Overcoming Challenges

1. Because my mockup was minimalist in design, I have chosen Bootstrap.
2. I used the Carousel feature in Bootstrap.
3. I found on the internet how to create a Favicon.

## What I Learned

I learned that Bootstrap is better to choose if the mockup is simple in design and minimalist, and to overcome a challenge is by searching the internet for a solution.
